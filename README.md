### ⚠️ Attention non-Windows users!
This scenario has been tested exclusively on Windows. Behavior on other platforms, such as Linux, may differ due to platform-specific factors. Specifically:
- The function app runs on Windows during local builds and deployments.
- Linux is currently unsupported due to these constraints.

If you are testing or deploying on a non-Windows platform, we encourage you to validate the templates, make any necessary modifications, and consider contributing your findings or improvements back to this repository.
